**Team #30 (Big Toes and a Dream), project title: Covid 19 Vaccination**

**Overall Presentation: A+**

The team provided a very detailed and informative presentation of their project. They managed to show all the parts, such as the ERD, sample queries, samples of the code they used for populating and migration, and the challenges they faced during implementation.

**Complexity/Applicability of the database application: A**

The design and structure of the teamâ€™s database were overall clear and effective. However, one minor issue that could be improved is the modeling of the Vaccination Type entity. The team implemented it as a weak entity for Vaccination. It could be more appropriate to represent Vaccination Type as a separate entity, since vaccination types can exist independently of the vaccination process. This would be more accurate regarding real-world relationships and provide a clearer database structure.

**Use of technology: A+**

The team used PostgreSQL for a relational database and Neo4j for a NoSQL database. This was a good choice regarding the scope and requirements of the project. Both of these provide flexible and easy use for data handling in this project.

**The presentation addresses all challenges: A+**

The presentation addressed all the challenges they faced during the implementation phases, such as finding a reliable API, the CSV processing with the very large data sizes, the hardware differences, and how the performance will vary on different systems. They showcased that to resolve these issues, they refined the queries and optimized their hardware.

**Teamwork and participation: A+**

The team showed that they distributed the work on the presentation equally among themselves. Everyone participated during the presentation.

**Additional comment/suggestion:**

The team can refine their database structure for the Vaccination Type entity. Everything else was planned perfectly.
