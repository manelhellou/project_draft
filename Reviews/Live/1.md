**Team #5 (Ctrl + Alt + Brian), project title: Climate tour**

**Overall Presentation: A+**

The team provided a well-detailed presentation, explaining the concept of their database design. They explained the migration process in detail and explained how they used Docker for importing the data. 

**Complexity/Applicability of the database application: A**

The team demonstrated a clear understanding of the database structure requirements. However, they did not provide a detailed ERD model for the viewers to fully understand the scope of their work. Including an ERD, even if it was a simple version, would have improved the clarity of the presentation for the viewers. It would have given them the opportunity to have a visual representation of the system’s structure. 

**Use of technology: A+**

The team used PostgreSQL for a relational database and Neo4j for a NoSQL database. This was a good choice regarding the scope and requirements of the project. Both of these provide flexible and easy use for data handling in this project.

**The presentation addresses all challenges: A+**

They covered all the challenges they faced during both implementation phases. They showed how the API rate limit affected their efficiency and work. Another challenge they faced was with the pipeline they implemented for the project. A quick review of their solution for the problems would have been helpful as well.

**Teamwork and participation: A+**

The team demonstrated good coordination and a fair distribution of responsibilities. All members participated in the presentation, which reflected effective collaboration and equal contribution to the project.

**Additional comment/suggestion:**

Providing a clearer ERD would have benefited the audience’s understanding of the database structure. Additionally, including a brief overview of how the team addressed the challenges they encountered would have enhanced the presentation.
