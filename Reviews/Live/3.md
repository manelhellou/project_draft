**Team #14 (The sewer rats), project title: Games**

**Overall Presentation: A+**

The team managed to show all the requirements of the presentation in detail. They explained all parts and provided visual examples to help with the understanding of the viewer.

**Complexity/Applicability of the database application: A+**

The design of their database was done carefully. They managed to design the weak entities, the ISA relationship, as well as the aggregation in appropriate places in their structure. This helped them to have a clear storage of data and be able to retrieve data easily. After the migration, they changed that structure so it would fit the NoSQL database. They merged the relationship tables into the Steam Product, which made accessing the data easier and clearer in a NoSQL environment.

**Use of technology: A+**

They used PostgreSQL as a relational database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Both of these technologies are a good choice for this project. They provide flexible data storage and retrieval. They allow the team to effectively work on the project and meet the requirements.

**The presentation addresses all challenges: A+**

They addressed some of the challenges they faced during the implementation phases. Such as the API rate limits, linking entries, and file size limit for uploading on GitHub. They also mentioned their solutions to these problems. It was very helpful that they presented the solutions because it helps learning from their experience, and understand their project more in detail.

**Teamwork and participation: A+**

They showed that all the members have been working on this project, and they have distributed the work among them during the implementation phases as well. They all contributed to the presentation as well.

**Additional comment/suggestion:**

There isnâ€™t any additional comment for improvement for this team, as they completed all the requirements and managed to show their work and how it was structured completely.
